However, almost at the end of our project, we got to know that the solution is supposed to be HMac...

HMac: validation string = Hash (message + Hash (key + message))
in the QRCode : message + validation string
securty issue: if someone(the man in the middle) generates a message (a valid ticket), it is supposed to be denied by the bus because there's no validation string.
To generate a valid hashcode, one should firstly hack into the bus or the web sytem to get the key.
In what context is HMac secure enough in the T4Y system: users never leak their QRCodes to anyone else.

Based on the same assumption: we decided to generate the url of the user's profile in the QRCode.
securityissue: if someone wants to generate a url that is supposed to be valid, one should firstly hack in to the web system and put the fake user's profile into the web.
QProbably as secure as HMac because of the assumption(the QRCode is always well protected).
But a disadvantage in our system is: we assume a stable connection between Bus and Web on the Internet :(, meanwhile HMac does not..
